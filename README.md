# industry_carbon_emission_analysis

In this project we use PostgreSQL to analyze the product carbon footprint (PCFs) across different industries.
The data we are using here is publicly available on nature.com

The data contains a collection of records across many years however, our focus is for the most recent product emission.

The first task thus involves answering the question:
* What is the most recent year of data that we have available to us?

With that answered, we can filter our data to include information about the different industries, number of companies and total PCF contribution made in the recent year.
